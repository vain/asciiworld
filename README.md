Having a little bit of fun.

Inspired by the world map in [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib).

Dependencies
------------

You need a map. I suggest you use one of those:

* [Natural Earth Data, Land](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/110m-land/)
* [Natural Earth Data, Countries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/)

Since NED distributes their data as "ESRI Shapefiles", you also need this library:

* [Shapelib](http://shapelib.maptools.org/)

In Arch Linux, the library is available in the package [shapelib](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/shapelib/).

More ideas
----------

*  Zoom/pan/crop.
*  Highlight locations or areas.
*  Add a day-and-night mode.
*  Highlight countries.
